    <p>Hello everyone. I would like to begin by introducing myself.</p>
    <p>I am a single brother with no children of my own yet. I am 
     from Mahikeng, which is a small town situated in the North West
     province of South Africa. The weather in our town is quite
     unpredictable as it can change from hot to cold or sunny to cloudy
     on any given day.</p>    
    <p>I have done a bit of travelling and have been able to live in
     parts of South Africa and even across the border in Botswana before
     returning to my home town.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
     Saints for 18 years now. I also had the privilege of serving a 
     full-time mission in the South Africa Cape Town Mission from
     September 2008 to October 2010. The things that I love about the
     church are its teachings about Jesus Christ, the holy scriptures,
     temples, opportunities to serve and the BYU-Pathway program.</p>
    <p>I currently work in sales in the insurance industry and it is
     quite a challenging job. I have decided to enrol for the Web and
     Computer Programming certificate to learn more about the design
     of websites and to give myself better job prospects in the future.
     I am currently enjoying learning new things about the design
     of websites.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to getting to know all of my new classmates
     and learning together. Thank you all for making time to have a look
     at my webpage.</p>
